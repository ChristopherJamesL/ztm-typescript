// You are developing a car rental system where each car is identified by its
// license plate number. The system should track the availability of cars in
// the rental fleet. Implement this system using a `Map` within a class.
//
// Requirements:
// - Create a `CarRental` class that uses a `Map` to store cars.
// - Each car should be represented by an object containing the car model
//   (string) and its availability status (boolean).
// - Implement functionality to:
//   - Add a new car to the rental fleet.
//   - Update the availability status of a car when it's rented or returned.
//   - Retrieve and print the details of a car by its license plate number.
//   - Print out all cars and their details.
// - Check your code by changing the availability of a car
